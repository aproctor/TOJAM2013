Game in which you play a superhero but every time you use your powers you gradually gain weight.
* http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/runner/
* each ability adds weight, which slows you down
* eventually will be too slow to make jumps
* time spent not using powers will thin you out

special abilities:
 * double jump
 * sprint
 * fly
 * wall smash

Running after criminal? or away from disaster
  * criminal would be harder to accomplish
  * criminal would add win-state

Imagine an entire game set in a traffic jam where you fall in love with the driver next to you. You help each other get through the jam.
* passage jam
* drivers could hold hands, you can seperate to get around obstacles, but must leave the area together or you lose
* first few puzzles could be trivial to solve alone

A racing game based in areas filled with people, you can rewind to avoid hitting them but every rewind makes your car faster.
+ mechanically fun
- time rewinding would probably eat too much time (Rewind time manager?)
* http://u3d.as/content/voodoo/rewind-time-manager/3kh
+ death animations would be funny
- probably won't be able to animate them well enough
- crowd mentality would be a bit difficult to do well
